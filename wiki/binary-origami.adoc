*Binary-Origami Figuration* is the conceptual framework behind bofig. This page explains what the name means and why it matters.

== What is Binary-Origami?

Think of evidence like a flat sheet of paper. On its own, it's just data—claims, sources, relationships, scores. But depending on who's looking and what they need, that same sheet can be *folded* into completely different shapes.

=== The Three Components

[cols="1,3,3"]
|===
| Component | Meaning | Example

| *Binary*
| The clear, discrete relationships in evidence (supports/contradicts/contextualizes) and the 0-100 scores that make epistemology measurable
| A claim has a PROMPT score of 85. An evidence item either supports or contradicts. No ambiguity.

| *Origami*
| The art of _folding_ evidence into different shapes for different audiences—without losing the original structure
| A researcher sees methodology first. A policymaker sees recommendations. Same evidence, different "folds."

| *Figuration*
| The process of structuring information so it can be unfolded and refolded for clarity, reversibility, and interoperability
| Navigation paths that let any user trace back to primary sources
|===

== Why This Metaphor Matters

=== Reversibility

Just like you can unfold origami back to a flat sheet, users can *always trace back* to the original evidence. No information is lost in the folding.

=== Interoperability

The same evidence can be "folded" into formats for:

* Zotero reference managers
* GraphQL APIs
* JSON-LD for semantic web
* D3.js visualizations

=== Multiple Perspectives

Different audiences need different entry points to the same truth:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Audience | Their "Fold"

| *Researcher*
| Evidence-first, methodology priority, replicability emphasized

| *Policymaker*
| Authoritative sources, recommendations, publication venue

| *Affected Person*
| Personal impact, clarity, transparency

| *Skeptic*
| Counter-evidence surfaced, methodology scrutinized

| *Journalist*
| Provenance chains, source verification, PROMPT scores visible
|===

== The Philosophical Core

[quote, Jonathan Jewell]
____
We didn't fall from Truth to Post-Truth; we evolved to complex epistemology without building infrastructure. *This system IS that infrastructure.*
____

Binary-Origami Figuration addresses a fundamental problem: how do we *coordinate without consensus*?

In investigative journalism, activists, policymakers, researchers, and affected communities rarely agree on what evidence means. But they can all work with the *same evidence* if it's structured to support their different perspectives.

=== Key Design Principles

1. **Same data, multiple views**: The evidence graph is one structure. Navigation paths create different "folds."
2. **Measurable epistemology**: PROMPT scores make quality explicit, not implicit.
3. **Navigation over narration**: Users choose their path through evidence, not the author.
4. **Reversibility**: Every fold can be unfolded. Every path can be retraced.

== How It Works in Practice

=== Example: UK Inflation 2023 Investigation

The test dataset includes 7 claims and 30 evidence items about UK inflation.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Claim | "Energy price cap increases drove inflation higher than headline CPI"

| *Supporting Evidence*
| ONS CPI data, Ofgem price cap announcements

| *Contradicting Evidence*
| BoE analysis showing food prices as primary driver

| *Contextualizing Evidence*
| Resolution Foundation reports on distributional impact
|===

**Three folds of the same evidence:**

1. **Researcher Path**: Starts with methodology (how was CPI calculated?), leads to source data, ends with interpretation conflicts

2. **Policymaker Path**: Starts with official sources (ONS, BoE), leads to actionable findings, ends with policy recommendations

3. **Affected Person Path**: Starts with personal impact (how much more am I paying?), leads to causes, ends with systemic explanations

== FAQ

[qanda]
Why not just use a wiki or CMS?::
    Wikis and CMSs don't have built-in epistemological scoring, audience-specific navigation, or formal reversibility. They store content; bofig structures *evidence relationships*.

Is this just a graph database with extra steps?::
    No. Graph databases store relationships. Bofig adds: (1) PROMPT scoring for measurable quality, (2) boundary object paths for multi-stakeholder coordination, (3) reversible folding patterns for different audiences.

What does "figuration" add to "binary-origami"?::
    Figuration is the *process* of structuring. It implies intentional design, not just storage. The system doesn't just hold data—it shapes how that data can be understood across contexts.
