Common questions about bofig, Binary-Origami Figuration, and the underlying concepts.

toc::[]

== General Questions

=== What is bofig?

*bofig* (Binary-Origami Figuration) is infrastructure for investigative journalism that lets different audiences explore the same evidence in different ways. It combines:

* **i-docs navigation**: Reader-driven exploration instead of author-controlled narration
* **PROMPT scoring**: 6-dimensional quality metrics for evidence
* **Boundary objects theory**: Same evidence, multiple valid interpretations

=== Why the name "bofig"?

*B*inary-*O*rigami *Fig*uration:

* **Binary**: The clear, measurable relationships (supports/contradicts, 0-100 scores)
* **Origami**: The art of folding evidence into different shapes for different audiences
* **Figuration**: The intentional process of structuring information for clarity

=== Who is this for?

* **Investigative journalists** who want to present complex evidence accessibly
* **Researchers** who want to share data with non-academic audiences
* **Policymakers** who need evidence-based decision support
* **Affected communities** who want to understand systemic issues
* **Anyone** who wants epistemological rigor without gatekeeping

=== Is this just another database?

No. Databases store data. Bofig structures *evidence relationships* with built-in epistemological scoring and multi-perspective navigation. It's closer to an "evidence operating system."

== Technical Questions

=== Why ArangoDB instead of Neo4j or PostgreSQL?

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Reason | Explanation

| Multi-model
| ArangoDB handles both documents (claims, evidence) and graphs (relationships) natively

| Elixir support
| The `arangox` driver is mature and well-maintained

| Cost
| ArangoDB Oasis managed hosting is €45/month vs. higher Neo4j pricing

| License
| Apache 2.0 (permissive) vs. Neo4j's GPL/commercial split
|===

See link:../docs/database-evaluation.md[docs/database-evaluation.md] for detailed benchmarks.

=== Why Elixir/Phoenix instead of Node.js or Python?

* **Concurrency**: Elixir's actor model handles many simultaneous users efficiently
* **Fault tolerance**: OTP supervision trees recover from failures gracefully
* **LiveView**: Real-time UI without a JavaScript framework
* **Functional**: Immutable data and pattern matching reduce bugs

Per the link:../.claude/CLAUDE.md[language policy], we use ReScript for frontend code and avoid Python/Node.js.

=== Can I use this without PROMPT scoring?

Yes! PROMPT scoring is optional. You can:

* Add evidence without scores
* Add scores incrementally over time
* Completely ignore scores and use bofig as a pure evidence graph

We made scoring optional to reduce adoption friction.

=== What's the GraphQL vs. REST split?

* **GraphQL** (Absinthe): All complex queries, mutations, graph traversals
* **REST**: Simple operations like Zotero import/export, health checks

Most users interact through GraphQL at `/api/graphiql`.

== Conceptual Questions

=== What's the difference between "navigation" and "narration"?

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Narration | Navigation

| Author decides the order
| *Reader chooses the path*

| One story, one interpretation
| *Same evidence, multiple routes*

| "Here's what happened"
| *"Here's the evidence—explore"*
|===

See link:navigation.adoc[i-docs Navigation] for details.

=== Why "coordination without consensus"?

Different stakeholders often can't agree on what evidence *means*. But they can work together if they agree on what the evidence *is*.

A policymaker and an activist looking at the same inflation data will draw different conclusions—and that's fine. Bofig makes the *basis* for their conclusions visible.

=== How are PROMPT scores different from peer review?

Peer review is binary (published or not). PROMPT is multi-dimensional:

* An interview might score high on provenance (named expert) but low on replicability (can't re-interview)
* A dataset might score high on transparency (fully open) but low on methodology (small sample)

PROMPT captures nuance that binary peer review misses.

=== What's a "boundary object"?

Something that different communities use together, even when they understand it differently. A map is a boundary object—tourists, engineers, and soldiers all use the same map for different purposes.

In bofig, evidence is the boundary object. See link:boundary-objects.adoc[Boundary Objects] for the full explanation.

== Practical Questions

=== How do I get started?

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/bofig.git`
2. Start ArangoDB: `podman run -d -p 8529:8529 -e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=dev arangodb/arangodb:3.11`
3. Install dependencies: `mix deps.get`
4. Load test data: `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
5. Start Phoenix: `mix phx.server`
6. Visit: http://localhost:4000/api/graphiql

See the link:../README.adoc[README] for detailed setup instructions.

=== Can I contribute?

Yes! The project is open source from day 1. See the link:../CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING] guide.

Priority areas:

* Zotero browser extension (Phase 1)
* D3.js visualization improvements
* PROMPT scoring UI
* Documentation improvements

=== How do I create a navigation path?

Via GraphQL:

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  createNavigationPath(input: {
    investigationId: "uk_inflation_2023"
    audienceType: RESEARCHER
    name: "Methodology Deep-Dive"
    pathNodes: [
      {entityId: "ons_methodology", order: 1, context: "How is CPI calculated?"},
      {entityId: "claim_1", order: 2, context: "The central claim"}
    ]
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
----

Or let bofig auto-generate one:

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  autoGeneratePath(
    investigationId: "uk_inflation_2023"
    audienceType: SKEPTIC
  ) {
    id
    pathNodes { entityId order }
  }
}
----

=== How do I import from Zotero?

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  importFromZotero(
    investigationId: "uk_inflation_2023"
    zoteroJson: {
      key: "ABC123"
      itemType: "journalArticle"
      title: "Economic Analysis of Inflation"
      # ... other Zotero fields
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    zoteroKey
  }
}
----

See link:../docs/zotero-integration.md[docs/zotero-integration.md] for two-way sync details.

== Philosophical Questions

=== Doesn't this just enable "post-truth" by saying all interpretations are valid?

No. Bofig distinguishes between:

* **Evidence**: The facts (same for everyone)
* **Interpretation**: What the facts mean (audience-specific)

A skeptic can't deny that ONS data exists. They can question what it means. The PROMPT framework makes the *quality* of evidence explicit, preventing "alternative facts."

=== Who decides the PROMPT scores?

Currently, the journalist or researcher adding evidence assigns scores. Future versions may include:

* Crowd-sourced scoring with reputation systems
* Automated scoring based on metadata (peer review status, data availability)
* Calibration against expert panels

=== What's the difference between this and fact-checking?

Fact-checkers produce binary verdicts (true/false/misleading). Bofig provides:

* Multi-dimensional scores (not just true/false)
* Multiple audience perspectives (not one authoritative view)
* Exploration tools (not just conclusions)

Fact-checking tells you what to believe. Bofig shows you *how* to evaluate evidence.

=== Why should I trust this system?

You shouldn't trust the *system*—you should trust the *evidence* (and verify it). Bofig is infrastructure, not an oracle. Every claim links to primary sources. Every PROMPT score is visible and contestable.

If you disagree with a score, create your own navigation path emphasizing different evidence. The system supports disagreement as a feature, not a bug.
