Definitions of key terms used in bofig and the Binary-Origami Figuration framework.

toc::[]

== A

[[arango]]
ArangoDB::
  A multi-model database that combines document and graph capabilities. Bofig uses ArangoDB to store claims, evidence, and their relationships in a single system.

[[audience-type]]
Audience Type::
  One of six predefined stakeholder categories: Researcher, Policymaker, Activist, Skeptic, Affected Person, Journalist. Each type has different PROMPT weight priorities that shape navigation paths.

[[aql]]
AQL (ArangoDB Query Language)::
  The query language for ArangoDB, similar to SQL but with native graph traversal support. Used internally by bofig for complex evidence chain queries.

== B

[[binary]]
Binary::
  In the context of Binary-Origami Figuration, refers to the clear, discrete relationships in evidence: supports/contradicts/contextualizes, 0-100 scores, yes/no verifiability. Binary doesn't mean "two options" but rather "clearly defined and measurable."

[[binary-origami]]
Binary-Origami Figuration::
  The conceptual framework behind bofig. Combines:
  * **Binary**: Measurable evidence relationships and scores
  * **Origami**: Folding evidence into different shapes for different audiences
  * **Figuration**: The intentional process of structuring information
  +
  See link:binary-origami.adoc[Binary-Origami Figuration] for full explanation.

[[bofig]]
bofig::
  The shorthand name for this project. Stands for *B*inary-*O*rigami *Fig*uration. Also the repository name.

[[boundary-object]]
Boundary Object::
  A concept from sociology (Star & Griesemer, 1989). Objects that different communities use together while understanding them differently. In bofig, evidence serves as a boundary object—activists and policymakers access the same data but interpret it for their contexts. See link:boundary-objects.adoc[Boundary Objects].

== C

[[claim]]
Claim::
  A statement that can be supported or contradicted by evidence. In bofig, claims have:
  * `text`: The claim itself
  * `claim_type`: PRIMARY, SUPPORTING, or COUNTER
  * `confidence_level`: 0.0 to 1.0
  * `prompt_scores`: PROMPT scoring metrics

[[confidence]]
Confidence::
  A 0.0-1.0 score indicating how certain a relationship or claim is. Distinct from weight—a relationship can have high weight (strong support) but low confidence (uncertain).

[[contradiction]]
Contradicts::
  One of three relationship types. Evidence contradicts a claim when it provides reasons to doubt or disbelieve the claim. Represented with negative weights (-1.0 to 0).

[[contextualization]]
Contextualizes::
  One of three relationship types. Evidence contextualizes when it provides background without directly supporting or contradicting. Represented with neutral weights.

== D

[[dublin-core]]
Dublin Core::
  A metadata standard for describing digital resources. Bofig stores Dublin Core metadata to ensure evidence is interoperable with academic repositories and search systems.

== E

[[edge]]
Edge::
  In graph terminology, a connection between two nodes. In bofig, edges represent relationships between claims and evidence (supports, contradicts, contextualizes).

[[evidence]]
Evidence::
  Materials that support or contradict claims. Types include: DOCUMENT, DATASET, INTERVIEW, MEDIA, OTHER. Each evidence item has PROMPT scores and can link to external sources (URLs, IPFS hashes, Zotero keys).

[[evidence-chain]]
Evidence Chain::
  A traversal through the evidence graph following relationships. Example: claim₁ → evidence₁ → claim₂ → evidence₂. Chains show how evidence connects across multiple hops.

[[evidence-graph]]
Evidence Graph::
  The underlying data structure: nodes (claims, evidence) connected by edges (relationships). See link:graphs.adoc[Evidence Graphs].

== F

[[figuration]]
Figuration::
  The process of structuring information intentionally. Not just storage, but shaping how data can be understood across contexts. The "figuration" in Binary-Origami Figuration emphasizes intentional design.

[[fold]]
Fold::
  Metaphor for organizing evidence for a specific audience. A "researcher fold" orders evidence by methodology; a "policymaker fold" orders by authority. Same evidence, different arrangements.

== G

[[graph-traversal]]
Graph Traversal::
  Moving through a graph by following edges. Bofig's `evidenceChain` and `findPath` queries traverse the evidence graph to find connected items.

[[graphql]]
GraphQL::
  A query language for APIs. Bofig uses GraphQL (via Absinthe) for all complex operations. Clients can request exactly the data they need.

== I

[[i-docs]]
i-docs (Interactive Documentary)::
  A documentary form that emphasizes reader/viewer agency over author-controlled narrative. Pioneered by MIT Open Doc Lab. Bofig applies i-docs principles to evidence presentation. See link:navigation.adoc[i-docs Navigation].

[[investigation]]
Investigation::
  A container for related claims and evidence. Has a title, status (DRAFT, REVIEW, PUBLISHED, ARCHIVED), collaborators, and associated navigation paths.

[[ipfs]]
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)::
  A distributed file system for storing and sharing data. Bofig stores IPFS hashes for evidence to provide tamper-proof provenance.

== J

[[json-ld]]
JSON-LD::
  A JSON-based format for linked data. Bofig stores evidence in JSON-LD-ready format to enable future semantic web integration.

== M

[[methodology]]
Methodology (PROMPT dimension)::
  One of six PROMPT dimensions. Measures the rigor of data collection and analysis. High methodology scores indicate robust research methods.

== N

[[navigation-path]]
Navigation Path::
  A curated sequence of claims and evidence designed for a specific audience type. Includes:
  * `audience_type`: Who this path is for
  * `path_nodes`: Ordered list of entities with context
  * `entry_points`: Starting points for exploration
  +
  See link:navigation.adoc[i-docs Navigation].

[[node]]
Node::
  In graph terminology, a discrete entity (vertex). In bofig, nodes are either claims or evidence items.

== O

[[objective]]
Objective (PROMPT dimension)::
  One of six PROMPT dimensions. Measures whether key terms are operationally defined. High scores mean concepts are clearly specified and measurable.

[[origami]]
Origami::
  The art of paper folding. In Binary-Origami Figuration, a metaphor for organizing the same evidence into different shapes (navigation paths) for different audiences without losing the original structure.

[[overall-score]]
Overall Score::
  A weighted average of the six PROMPT dimensions. Default weights: Provenance 20%, Replicability 15%, Objective 15%, Methodology 20%, Publication 15%, Transparency 15%.

== P

[[path-node]]
Path Node::
  A single step in a navigation path. Contains:
  * `entity_id`: Which claim or evidence to show
  * `order`: Position in the sequence
  * `context`: Why this item appears here
  * `emphasis`: What to highlight

[[plasticity]]
Plasticity::
  The ability of boundary objects to be shaped for local needs. In bofig, navigation paths provide plasticity—same evidence, different arrangements.

[[pragmatic-epistemology]]
Pragmatic Epistemology::
  A philosophical approach that focuses on the practical consequences of beliefs rather than abstract truth. Bofig's PROMPT framework operationalizes pragmatic epistemology by asking "how would this evidence help different stakeholders?"

[[prompt]]
PROMPT::
  The 6-dimensional epistemological scoring framework:
  * **P**rovenance: Source credibility
  * **R**eplicability: Verifiability
  * **O**bjective: Operational definitions
  * **M**ethodology: Research rigor
  * **P**ublication: Venue quality
  * **T**ransparency: Openness
  +
  See link:prompt.adoc[PROMPT Scoring].

[[provenance]]
Provenance (PROMPT dimension)::
  One of six PROMPT dimensions. Measures source credibility. High scores for primary sources (original data, official publications), lower for secondary/tertiary sources.

[[publication]]
Publication (PROMPT dimension)::
  One of six PROMPT dimensions. Measures the venue where evidence appeared. High scores for peer-reviewed journals, lower for self-published or anonymous sources.

== R

[[relationship]]
Relationship::
  A connection between a claim and evidence (or between claims). Types: SUPPORTS, CONTRADICTS, CONTEXTUALIZES. Each has a weight (-1.0 to +1.0) and confidence (0.0 to 1.0).

[[replicability]]
Replicability (PROMPT dimension)::
  One of six PROMPT dimensions. Measures whether others could verify the evidence independently. High scores when methodology and data are public.

[[reversibility]]
Reversibility::
  A key property of Binary-Origami Figuration. Users can always trace back from any navigation path to the original evidence. No information is lost in folding.

[[robustness]]
Robustness::
  The property of boundary objects that maintains core structure across different uses. In bofig, the evidence graph is robust—same nodes and edges regardless of navigation path.

== S

[[schema-org]]
Schema.org::
  A vocabulary for structured data. Bofig stores Schema.org metadata to enable semantic web compatibility and rich search results.

[[supports]]
Supports::
  One of three relationship types. Evidence supports a claim when it provides reasons to believe the claim. Represented with positive weights (0 to +1.0).

== T

[[transparency]]
Transparency (PROMPT dimension)::
  One of six PROMPT dimensions. Measures how openly available the evidence's data and methods are. High scores when everything is public; lower when restricted.

[[traversal]]
Traversal::
  See [[graph-traversal]].

== W

[[weight]]
Weight::
  A -1.0 to +1.0 score on relationships indicating strength. Positive = support, negative = contradiction, near-zero = contextual. Distinct from confidence—weight indicates direction, confidence indicates certainty.

== Z

[[zotero]]
Zotero::
  An open-source reference management tool. Bofig integrates with Zotero for evidence import/export, enabling researchers to use familiar workflows.

[[zotero-key]]
Zotero Key::
  A unique identifier for items in Zotero. Bofig stores Zotero keys to enable two-way synchronization between Zotero libraries and the evidence graph.
