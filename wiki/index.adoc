[.lead]
Welcome to the bofig wiki—your guide to understanding Binary-Origami Figuration and the infrastructure for pragmatic epistemology.

[quote, Jonathan Jewell]
____
We didn't fall from Truth to Post-Truth; we evolved to complex epistemology without building infrastructure. *This system IS that infrastructure.*

| *Binary-Origami*
| Evidence can be "folded" into different shapes for different audiences
| link:binary-origami.adoc[Full explanation]

| *i-docs Navigation*
| Users choose their path through evidence—navigation over narration
| link:navigation.adoc[Full explanation]

| *PROMPT Scoring*
| 6-dimensional "nutrition labels" for evidence quality
| link:prompt.adoc[Full explanation]

| *Boundary Objects*
| Same evidence, multiple valid interpretations—coordination without consensus
| link:boundary-objects.adoc[Full explanation]

| *Evidence Graphs*
| The underlying structure of claims, evidence, and relationships

== The Metaphor in Brief

THE FLAT SHEET (Raw Evidence)
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Claims  ║ Evidence  ║  Relationships  ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

         ↓ FOLD for Researcher ↓

          /\
         /  \    ← Methodology-first
        /____\
       /_/\__\_\

         ↓ FOLD for Policymaker ↓

SAME PAPER. DIFFERENT SHAPES.

Every fold is *reversible*. Users can always trace back to the original evidence.

== Why This Wiki Exists

Some feedback we've received:

____
"I don't understand what this project does."
"The terminology is confusing."
"Why is it called 'binary-origami'?"
____

Fair points. This wiki exists to:

1. **Explain the metaphor** in plain language with diagrams
2. **Connect abstract concepts** to practical implementation
3. **Provide multiple entry points** for different learning styles
4. **Make the project accessible** to journalists, not just developers

If something is still unclear after reading these pages, please link:https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/bofig/issues[open an issue]. The goal is clarity for everyone.
