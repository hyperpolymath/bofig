*Navigation over narration*—the core principle that lets different audiences explore evidence in different ways.

toc::[]

== What is i-docs Navigation?

Interactive documentaries (i-docs) pioneered a radical idea: instead of telling viewers a linear story, let them *navigate* through content based on their interests.

Bofig applies this principle to evidence:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Traditional Journalism | i-docs Approach

| Author decides order
| *Reader chooses path*

| One narrative thread
| *Multiple entry points*

| "Here's the story"
| *"Here's the evidence—explore"*

| Passive consumption
| *Active investigation*
|===

== The "Choose Your Own Adventure" Metaphor

Remember those books where you'd read to a decision point, then flip to page 47 or page 112 depending on your choice?

Bofig works the same way with evidence:

[source,text]
----
START: "Did UK inflation hurt low-income households more?"
        |
        ├── "I want methodology first"
        │         ↓
        │   [ONS CPI methodology docs]
        │         ↓
        │   [Academic critiques of CPI weighting]
        │         ↓
        │   [Alternative indices (RPI, CPIH)]
        │
        └── "I want impact first"
                  ↓
            [Resolution Foundation report]
                  ↓
            [Food bank usage statistics]
                  ↓
            [Personal testimonies]
----

Both paths lead to the same underlying evidence—but the *order* and *emphasis* differ.

== Navigation Paths in Bofig

=== What is a Navigation Path?

A **Navigation Path** is a curated sequence of claims and evidence designed for a specific audience.

[source,elixir]
----
%NavigationPath{
  id: "path_researcher_inflation",
  audience_type: :researcher,
  name: "Methodological Deep-Dive",
  description: "Starts with data sources, ends with interpretation",
  path_nodes: [
    %{entity_id: "ons_cpi_methodology", order: 1, context: "How is CPI calculated?"},
    %{entity_id: "claim_primary", order: 2, context: "The central claim"},
    %{entity_id: "academic_study_1", order: 3, context: "Peer-reviewed verification"},
    %{entity_id: "counter_evidence_1", order: 4, context: "Alternative interpretations"}
  ]
}
----

=== Six Audience Types

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Audience | Priority | Starting Point

| *Researcher*
| Methodology, replicability
| Data sources, academic literature

| *Policymaker*
| Authority, actionability
| Official statistics, recommendations

| *Activist*
| Impact, provenance
| Affected communities, systemic causes

| *Skeptic*
| Counter-evidence, transparency
| Contradicting claims, methodology gaps

| *Affected Person*
| Clarity, personal relevance
| "What does this mean for me?"

| *Journalist*
| Source verification, PROMPT scores
| Primary documents, interview transcripts
|===

== How Navigation Paths Work

=== Entry Points

Every investigation has multiple entry points—different places to start depending on your needs:

* **Claim-first**: Start with the main argument, explore supporting evidence
* **Evidence-first**: Start with raw data, build toward claims
* **Question-first**: Start with a question, follow the thread

=== Path Nodes

Each node in a path includes:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Property | Purpose

| `entity_id`
| Which claim or evidence item to show

| `order`
| Where in the sequence (1, 2, 3...)

| `context`
| *Why* show this here? What's the audience's question at this point?

| `emphasis`
| What to highlight (e.g., show PROMPT scores for skeptics)
|===

=== Auto-Generated Paths

Bofig can automatically generate navigation paths based on audience type:

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  autoGeneratePath(
    investigationId: "uk_inflation_2023"
    audienceType: SKEPTIC
  ) {
    id
    name
    pathNodes {
      entityId
      order
      context
    }
  }
}
----

The algorithm:

1. **Sorts by audience-weighted PROMPT scores** (skeptics prioritize transparency)
2. **Surfaces counter-evidence early** (skeptics want to see objections)
3. **Includes methodology gaps** (skeptics want to know what's missing)

== Example: Three Paths Through UK Inflation

=== Researcher Path

[source,text]
----
1. ONS CPI Methodology (PROMPT: 97.5)
   "How is CPI calculated?"
        ↓
2. Academic Study on Distributional Impact (PROMPT: 81.8)
   "Peer-reviewed analysis"
        ↓
3. Primary Claim: "Energy drove inflation"
   "The central argument"
        ↓
4. Counter-evidence: Food prices
   "Alternative interpretation"
        ↓
5. Methodology Limitations
   "What the data doesn't capture"
----

=== Policymaker Path

[source,text]
----
1. BoE Policy Statement (PROMPT: 92.0)
   "Official position"
        ↓
2. Primary Claim: "Energy drove inflation"
   "The issue requiring policy response"
        ↓
3. ONS Official Statistics (PROMPT: 97.5)
   "Authoritative data"
        ↓
4. Think Tank Recommendations (PROMPT: 72.3)
   "Actionable suggestions"
        ↓
5. Expected Outcomes
   "What happens if we act?"
----

=== Affected Person Path

[source,text]
----
1. "What does this mean for my bills?"
   Plain-language summary
        ↓
2. Resolution Foundation Report (PROMPT: 72.3)
   "Who's hit hardest?"
        ↓
3. Personal Testimonies
   "Stories from people like me"
        ↓
4. Primary Claim: "Energy drove inflation"
   "The bigger picture"
        ↓
5. What Can I Do?
   "Practical steps"
----

== Navigation vs. Narration

[cols="1,3,3"]
|===
| Aspect | Narration (Traditional) | Navigation (i-docs)

| Control
| Author controls flow
| *User chooses path*

| Structure
| Linear: beginning → end
| *Graph: multiple routes*

| Re-reading
| Same experience each time
| *Different paths, new insights*

| Bias
| Author's perspective embedded
| *Perspectives explicit via audience paths*

| Discovery
| "I'll tell you what matters"
| *"Explore what matters to YOU"*
|===

== Design Principles

=== 1. Every Path is Reversible

Users can always go back. Every node links to its sources. No dead ends.

=== 2. Same Evidence, Different Orders

The underlying data doesn't change—only the sequence and emphasis.

=== 3. Context is Everything

A `PathNode` without context is just a link. The `context` field answers: "Why am I seeing this *now*?"

=== 4. Paths Can Be Saved and Shared

Users can create their own paths and share them. "Here's how I explored this investigation."

== API Examples

=== Get Paths for an Investigation

[source,graphql]
----
query {
  navigationPaths(investigationId: "uk_inflation_2023") {
    id
    name
    audienceType
    pathNodes {
      entityId
      order
      context
    }
  }
}
----

=== Create a Custom Path

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  createNavigationPath(input: {
    investigationId: "uk_inflation_2023"
    audienceType: JOURNALIST
    name: "Source Verification Trail"
    pathNodes: [
      {entityId: "primary_claim", order: 1, context: "What are we verifying?"},
      {entityId: "ons_data", order: 2, context: "Primary source check"},
      {entityId: "interview_1", order: 3, context: "Expert commentary"}
    ]
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
